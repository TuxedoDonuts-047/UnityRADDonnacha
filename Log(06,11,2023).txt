Hello, today is Monday the 6th of November, 2023.
Today is my first day back to MTU after my mid term break.
I have RAD Games development on Wednesday. 

I just cloned my repository at quarter past ten in the evening via GIT GUI outside of college hours and on a laptop at home. 
Hope it counts towards my grade.

Once I am finished this log, i will thensend it back to my Github account via GIT BASH.I will then merge it with the one on Github and hopefully, this log will be added to it. =)
